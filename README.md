# 💊 Drug Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a **machine learning classifier** to predict the **type of drug** a patient should be prescribed based on medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. It’s a great example of applying ML in the **healthcare domain** for decision support.
